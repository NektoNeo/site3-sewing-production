## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Animations Implemented

### ✅ Hover Effects
- Card hover with translateY(-4px) and shadow effects
- Portfolio items with scale(1.02) on hover
- Shadow transitions with blue accent (shadow-blue-500/10)
- Smooth transition duration (200ms)

### ✅ Accessibility
- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Lenis smooth scroll disabled when reduced motion is preferred
- Motion wrapper component created for future use

## Test Results

Phase 3: shadcn/ui Components Integration - COMPLETED

✅ Installed dependencies:
- @radix-ui/react-accordion
- clsx (was already installed: class-variance-authority)

✅ Created UI components in components/ui/:
- button.tsx - Pill-shaped buttons with orange primary (#F45B31) and multiple variants
- card.tsx - Card with border and soft shadow
- input.tsx - Text input component
- textarea.tsx - Textarea component
- label.tsx - Form label component
- accordion.tsx - Radix-based accordion with animations
- table.tsx - Simple table implementation

✅ Configuration:
- Updated lib/utils.ts with correct clsx import
- Tailwind config already had accordion animations configured

✅ Testing:
- Created test page at app/test-ui/page.tsx
- All components render correctly
- Accordion functionality verified (expand/collapse works)
- Button variants display properly with pill shape
- Orange primary color (#F45B31) applied correctly

All acceptance criteria met:
- Components can be imported without errors
- Test page successfully demonstrates all components
- Interactive elements (accordion) work as expected
